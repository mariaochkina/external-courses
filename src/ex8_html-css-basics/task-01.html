Don't wait for fate, it won't fall on your head. If you like: do it.
         Do not make plans and do not attach much importance to this. Just do it.
         Eventually,everything will get better. Then you will know what is destined for you...</pre

      It’s surprising that people of different nationalities have their own
      habits of cooking and cuisine. It depends largely on geographic position
      of each country, its climate and soil. For example, American land is rich
      in corn, so people use this ingredient a lot in national cuisine.
      Ukrainian land is good for growing potatoes, beetroot and other
      vegetables.<br />
      England also has its peculiarities. I’d say, people grow mostly flowers
      there and gardening is one of their favourite pastimes. However, they also
      grow plenty of vegetables, such as, pumpkins, zucchini. And these
      vegetables along with beef are used largely in national cuisine.<br />
      For dessert, people cook various puddings.<br />
      For breakfast in England they have either an omelette or porridge. Some
      prefer toasts with butter and jam. Popular morning drinks are orange juice
      and coffee.<br />
